# Injury_Severity_Prediction_Using_Car_Crash_Data
Our data science project focuses on predicting injury severity in car crashes by leveraging machine learning techniques. We aim to understand and anticipate the severity of injuries resulting from traffic accidents by analyzing diverse factors such as speed limits, weather conditions, crash types, and other relevant features extracted from the dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of predictive models, including ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost. Through this project, we seek to contribute to the development of effective safety measures and accident prevention strategies by providing insights into the factors influencing injury severity in car crashes.
